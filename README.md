I'm (slowly) reading through "iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" to have a more well-rounded, book-educated background on iOS development and Swift programming. It seems a little basic, but I am hoping to learn a thing or two that I may have missed by originally learning from a more hands-on approach.

If nothing else, I am having fun hacking around and getting a better grasp of the [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) git client for macOS. üíÅ
